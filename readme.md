Very basic few page website I created as part of a coding diploma course. This was just following onlong with the instrutor. Even though the skills I currently have would have allowed me to create something beyond what I have here, I choose to just follow along, and perhaps I'll improve this in the future.

This isn't responsive as we didn't really go into much detail about responsiveness at this stage of the course. I might choose to make it responsive at another time.
